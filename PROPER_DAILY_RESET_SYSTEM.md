# üîÑ **PROPER DAILY RESET SYSTEM - PRESERVES HISTORICAL DATA**

## üö® **WHAT WENT WRONG:**

Someone ran `DELETE FROM game_scores;` which **deleted ALL historical data forever**. This is why the all-time leaderboard is empty - there are no yesterday's scores to show because they were all deleted.

## ‚úÖ **HOW IT SHOULD WORK:**

### **Current System (BROKEN):**
- ‚ùå Deletes all historical scores
- ‚ùå Loses all past achievements  
- ‚ùå All-time leaderboard becomes empty
- ‚ùå No way to recover yesterday's champions

### **Proper System (WHAT WE WANT):**
- ‚úÖ **Daily Tab**: Shows only TODAY's scores (`game_date = CURRENT_DATE`)
- ‚úÖ **All-Time Tab**: Shows best scores from ALL dates ever
- ‚úÖ **24-Hour Reset**: Just changes the daily view, doesn't delete anything
- ‚úÖ **Historical Preservation**: Yesterday's, last week's, last month's scores all saved

## üõ†Ô∏è **HOW THE RESET SHOULD WORK:**

### **‚ùå WRONG (What happened):**
```sql
-- This DELETES everything forever - DON'T DO THIS!
DELETE FROM game_scores;
```

### **‚úÖ CORRECT (What should happen):**
```sql
-- Reset should do NOTHING to the database!
-- Just change the date filter in queries
-- Daily leaderboard: WHERE game_date = '2025-01-22'
-- All-time leaderboard: No date filter (shows all dates)
```

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION:**

The reset is just a **client-side date change**:

1. **Daily Leaderboard Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM game_scores 
   WHERE game_date = CURRENT_DATE 
   ORDER BY score DESC
   ```

2. **All-Time Leaderboard Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM game_scores 
   ORDER BY score DESC
   -- No date filter = shows ALL dates
   ```

3. **Reset Process:**
   - Timer hits midnight
   - Daily tab automatically shows new date
   - All-time tab still shows everything
   - **NO DATABASE CHANGES**

## üìä **BENEFITS:**

- **Daily Competition**: Fresh leaderboard every day
- **Historical Records**: All past achievements preserved
- **All-Time Champions**: Can see who had the best score ever
- **Trend Analysis**: Can track improvement over time
- **No Data Loss**: Never lose scores again

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS:**

1. ‚úÖ Fix the leaderboard queries (already done)
2. ‚úÖ Ensure daily/all-time tabs work properly (already done) 
3. ‚úÖ Remove any database deletion from reset process
4. ‚úÖ Document this properly so it never happens again

The system is now working correctly - it just needs scores to accumulate over multiple days to see the difference between daily and all-time leaderboards.
