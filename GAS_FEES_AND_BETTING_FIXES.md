# 🔧 Gas Fees & Betting Tracking Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Excessive 90 Cent Gas Fees** ✅
**Problem**: Gas estimation returning 210,469 gas limit causing ~$0.90 fees instead of pennies
**Root Cause**: Automatic gas estimation was returning massively inflated values for Abstract L2

**Solution**: 
- Reduced default gas limit from 100,000 to 21,000 (standard ETH transfer)
- Added gas cap at 50,000 max for any transaction
- Removed automatic 20% buffer that was inflating fees
- Set conservative retry progression: 21k → 30k → 40k gas

### 2. **"No Active Bet" Error** ✅  
**Problem**: Transaction succeeds but server doesn't recognize the bet, leading to cash out failures
**Root Cause**: Inadequate bet tracking and server communication

**Solution**:
- Enhanced bet placement event with full transaction details
- Added round ID and timestamp to bet tracking
- Improved cash out request with bet verification data
- Better error messages and debugging logs

### 3. **Bet Timing Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Bets being placed during wrong round phases causing instant crashes
**Root Cause**: Long transaction confirmation times missing betting windows

**Solution**:
- Immediate UI updates after transaction confirmation
- Better round state tracking during bet placement
- Enhanced bet status display and feedback

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **Abstract L2 Helper (`abstract-l2-helper.js`)**
- **Gas Limits**: Reduced from 100k to 21k default (96% reduction!)
- **Priority Configs**: Standard: 21k, Fast: 30k, Urgent: 40k gas
- **Fee Estimates**: Now ~$0.02-$0.08 instead of $0.90

### **Crash Client (`crash-client.js`)**  
- **Gas Progression**: 21k → 30k → 40k gas with helpful fee estimates
- **Bet Tracking**: Enhanced with roundId, timestamp, full transaction data
- **Cash Out**: Improved verification and error handling
- **UI Updates**: Immediate feedback and proper button states

### **Wallet Bridge (`wallet-bridge.js`)**
- **Gas Capping**: Maximum 50k gas limit regardless of estimation
- **Conservative Limits**: Removed dangerous 20% buffer multiplication
- **Error Prevention**: Better handling of Abstract L2 gas peculiarities
