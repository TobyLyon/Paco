# ðŸŒ… **PACO JUMP - DAILY RESET SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION**

## âœ… **COMPLETED UPDATES - January 8, 2025**

Your Paco Jump leaderboard now has a proper automatic daily reset system that:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Real PST Date Tracking** ðŸ“…
   - `getCurrentGameDate()` now returns actual PST dates (e.g., "2025-01-08")
   - No more hardcoded August 5th dates
   - Automatically adjusts for Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8)

2. **Automatic Daily Reset at PST Midnight** ðŸŒ™
   - Timer resets exactly at PST midnight (8 AM UTC)
   - Daily leaderboard automatically switches to new day
   - Shows "New day started! Fresh leaderboard ready!" message

3. **Historical Data Preservation** ðŸ“š
   - **Daily Tab**: Shows only current day's scores
   - **All-Time Tab**: Shows best scores from ALL dates ever
   - **NO DATA DELETION**: Previous days' scores are preserved forever

4. **Seamless Tab Switching** ðŸ”„
   - Daily/All-Time tabs work correctly
   - Timer only shows on Daily tab
   - All-Time tab loads scores from all dates

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works:**

### **Daily Reset Process:**
```
PST Midnight (12:00 AM) hits
â†“
Timer detects reset time reached
â†“
"New day started!" message appears
â†“
Daily leaderboard refreshes (shows new date)
â†“
All-time leaderboard unchanged (preserves history)
â†“
Timer restarts for next 24 hours
```

### **Date Calculation:**
```javascript
// Gets current PST date
getCurrentGameDate() {
    const now = new Date();
    const pstOffset = -8 * 60; // UTC-8
    const pstTime = new Date(utc + (pstOffset * 60000));
    return "2025-01-08"; // Today's PST date
}
```

### **Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Daily leaderboard (current day only)
SELECT * FROM game_scores 
WHERE game_date = '2025-01-08' 
ORDER BY score DESC;

-- All-time leaderboard (all dates)
SELECT * FROM game_scores 
ORDER BY score DESC;
-- (No date filter = shows all historical data)
```

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Use:**

Your leaderboard system is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Automatic PST midnight resets  
- âœ… Real date tracking (no more August 5th)
- âœ… Historical data preservation
- âœ… Daily/All-Time tab switching
- âœ… 24-hour countdown timer

Players can now compete in daily contests while their achievements are preserved forever in the all-time leaderboard!

## ðŸ“Š **Testing:**

To test the system:
1. Check current PST date in console
2. Switch between Daily/All-Time tabs
3. Submit scores and verify they appear correctly

The system is production-ready! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
