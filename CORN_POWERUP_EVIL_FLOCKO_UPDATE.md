# 🌽⚡ **CORN POWER-UP: EVIL FLOCKO KILLING FIXED** ✅

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED:**

### **❌ Previous Behavior:**
- Player could only kill evil flockos when **BOTH** conditions were met:
  - ✅ Had corn power-up active
  - ✅ Was actively in "flying" state
- This made evil flocko killing inconsistent and limited

### **✅ New Behavior:**
- Player can kill evil flockos for the **ENTIRE DURATION** of the corn power-up
- No need to be in active "flying" state
- Works consistently throughout the corn power-up's duration

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL CHANGES:**

### **File: `game.js` (Line 520)**
**Before:**
```javascript
if (this.player.isFlying && this.activePowerups.has('corn')) {
    // Player has corn power-up - can defeat evil flocko!
    this.defeatEvilFlocko(platform, i);
    continue;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (this.activePowerups.has('corn')) {
    // Player has corn power-up - can defeat evil flocko!
    this.defeatEvilFlocko(platform, i);
    continue;
}
```

### **File: `game-integration-example.js` (Line 49)**
**Before:**
```javascript
if (this.player.isFlying && this.activePowerups.has('corn')) {
    // Player defeated evil flocko!
    this.defeatEvilFlocko(platform, i);
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (this.activePowerups.has('corn')) {
    // Player defeated evil flocko!
    this.defeatEvilFlocko(platform, i);
```
