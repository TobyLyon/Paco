## Security Notes

**Three-Wallet Architecture:**
- **House Wallet**: Cold storage for deposits only (no private key on server)
- **Hot Wallet**: Operational wallet for automated payouts/withdrawals (~1-5 ETH max)
- **Safe Wallet**: Deep cold storage for excess funds (multisig recommended)

**Fund Flow:**
```
üì• Deposits ‚Üí House Wallet
     ‚Üì (manual transfer)
üí∞ Hot Wallet (operational) 
     ‚Üì (excess funds)
üîí Safe Wallet (long-term storage)
```

**Operational Guidelines:**
- Keep hot wallet balance between 0.5-5 ETH for operations
- Transfer excess funds: Hot ‚Üí Safe Wallet (not back to house)
- House wallet is for deposits only - never send operational funds there
- Monitor all three wallets via `/admin/wallet-status`
